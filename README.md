Crop Detection Using Machine Learning

This project aims to identify and classify different crops from images using machine learning techniques. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect crop types and potentially identify disease patterns based on visual data.

Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the project on your local machine.

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-detection.git
cd crop-detection

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use 'venv\Scripts\activate'

Install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Training the Model

To train the crop detection model, run the following script:

python train_model.py

This script will:

    Load the dataset of crop images.
    Train a CNN model for classification.
    Save the trained model to model/crop_detection_model.h5.

Using the Model for Prediction

To use the trained model for detecting crops in new images, run:

python predict.py --image <path_to_image>

This will output the predicted crop type and any confidence scores.
Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images of various crop types (e.g., wheat, corn, rice, etc.) along with labels. You can download the dataset from [dataset_link] or use your own dataset following a similar structure.

    Image files should be placed in separate folders for each crop type.
    The dataset should be divided into training and testing subsets.

Model

The model architecture used is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which has proven effective for image classification tasks.

    Input Layer: Image data (e.g., 224x224x3 RGB images).
    Convolutional Layers: Multiple layers for feature extraction.
    Fully Connected Layers: For classification based on extracted features.
    Output Layer: Softmax activation function to classify the crop type.

The model is trained using an Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

    TensorFlow
    Keras
    NumPy
    Matplotlib
    OpenCV
    scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Results

The model can predict crop types from images with high accuracy. Example output:

    Input Image: path_to_image.jpg
    Predicted Crop: Wheat
    Confidence: 92%
